# Text Classification Using TextCNN
I have used TextCNN approach for classification of the given text. CNNs are generally used in computer vision, however they’ve recently been applied to various NLP tasks and the results were promising. The result of each convolution will fire when a special pattern is detected. By varying the size of the kernels and concatenating their outputs, you’re allowing yourself to detect patterns of multiples sizes. The input text contains two columns, the title and some description about it. The title and the description is concatenated together to get a single text input which is then fed to the TextCNN . The TextCNN consisted of a 3-layer 1D ConvNet followed by two Dense layers. 300 dimensional GloVe word embeddings were used for word vectorization. Dropout was used to avoid overfitting.
